DotNetify
=========

A .NET Spotify wrapper that attempts to encapsulate and abstract the libspotify C API as much as possible and useful.
Every feature of libspotify will be wrapped and nicely presented as classes. The reference counting algorithm of libspotify
will also be abstracted using <c>IDisposable</c>.
